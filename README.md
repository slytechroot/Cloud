Notes from my journey from IT and Security Engineering and operations to Security DevOps and DevSecOps!!! 
<BR><BR>
Course names are not used, because that's irrelevant as these are my notes to use on the job.

If you email me I can likely share the course names with you for your own purchase and use.
