🌟 Hey there, I’m sly!

🌍 Always learning something new — currently diving into [Cloud DevOps and DevSecOps]. 

Learning Git (GitHub, GitLab), Jenkins, Docker and AWS).

🎮 Fun fact: Notes from my journey from IT and Security Engineering and operations to Security DevOps and DevSecOps!!! 

🛠️ Course names are not used, because that's irrelevant as these are my notes to use on the job. <BR>
If you email me I can likely share the course names with you for your own purchase and use.
