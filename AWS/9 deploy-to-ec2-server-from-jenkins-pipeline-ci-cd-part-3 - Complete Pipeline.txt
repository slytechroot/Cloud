Complete Pipeline

Set Image name dynamically <---------------

Increment version (in pom.xml) -> Build app with Maven (with new version) -> Build and Push image (build and store new Docker Image version) -> Deploy to EC2 (deploy new version with docker-compose) -> Commit version bump.

Update the change in the Git repository code.

Next Pipeline must start with the new version.

Keep in mind the stage order!

When a stage fails, the next stage gets skipped!

Extract into groovy scripts.
Extract with Shared Library.

Container orchestration instead of Docker Compose.
