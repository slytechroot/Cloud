#Check the main branch and commit
git checkout main
git pull origin main
#Bump Version
git add .
git commit -m "Bump release version to v1.2.0"
git push origin main

Jenkins Build:
- run tests
- build docker image
- push to docker repository

- Manually modify a docker compose file (docker-compose.yml). 
- Connect to the Kubernetes cluster
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

- App run on a simple server:
ssh user@server-address
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
- once deployed the app is shared with the testers to get feedback from that team. 
- once all is confirmed, the deployment is shared to PROD for deployment.

Human involvment introduces risk and slows processes.
Test each branch individually before merging.
Avoid merging multiple big changes at once to avoid the confusion of which feature broke the app. 
Commit smaller changes, more frequently, test faster and fix early. That's CI!!!!
