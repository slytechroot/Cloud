Jenkins Build:
- run tests
- build docker image
- push to docker repository

- Manually modify a docker compose file (docker-compose.yml). 
- Connect to the Kubernetes cluster
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

- App run on a simple server:
ssh user@server-address
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
- once deployed the app is shared with the testers to get feedback from that team.
