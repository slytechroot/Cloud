Container services on AWS

- created an EC2 instance on AWS
- installed Docker to run containers
- we used AWS infrastructure

Microservices apps
- multiple container
- because of microservices, containers have become very popular.
- companies create apps that compromise multiple containers.

Things get to be very manual when we have to run multiple containers, install Docker, run commands. 

For this, AWS has Containers, ECRs, and Kubernetes.
