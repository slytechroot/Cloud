AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic
Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate primarily removes
the need to provision and manage servers and allows developers to specify resources for each
application.

To get started using GitLab and Fargate you’ll need your AWS stack in place:
1. An Amazon ECS cluster
2. A service that belongs to the cluster that runs Fargate tasks
3. An accessible container registry for Docker images
4. An Amazon ECS task definition that references a Docker image stored in your registry that
defines CPU and memory requirements
5. An application load balancer that redirects requests to healthy targets in a target group
6. A target group
