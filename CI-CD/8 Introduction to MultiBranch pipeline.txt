Introduction to multibranch pipeline

- this is about using additional Github branches in your pipeline
- this is useful in real life, as each branch hosts code for bug fixes, features, etc.
- additional you can run tests on every and any branch
- execute deployment only on Master Branch
- when merged into master: test, build and deploy App.

Pipelines for ALL the branches!!!!

Multibranch pipeline!


Create a multibranch pipeline.

Use this for repo pull:

Under Discover Branches, choose 'Filter by name (with regular expression)' and leave the default: 
.*

Property Strategy:
All branches get the same properties.

Once Save, the pipeline will trigger and create in Jenkins a pipeline for each Branch.

When you're ready modifying the Jenkinsfile, click 'Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now'.

We can then look at 'Scan Multibranch Pipeline Logs' to see build results.
