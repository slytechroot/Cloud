Freestyle to Pipeline Job <-----------

- with Freestyle we'd need multiple jobs for multiple steps, such as a Freestyle for:
	- running integration tests for your application
	- a second for building the application
	- another one for deploying the application
	- ... and so on ...

Developers used to use Post-build Actions in Jenkins to chain projects together. 
'Trigger only if build is stable'.
This has limitations:
- configuration via UI (not scripting)
- very dependant on plugin input fields
- not suitable for complex workflows
- enter - CI/CD pipelines!!!!

So this was before the pipelines came along. 

Pipeline jobs:
- suitable for CI/CD
- scripting - pipeline as code!!!
- using plugins
- executing tools
