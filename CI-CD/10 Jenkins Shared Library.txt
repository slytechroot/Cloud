Jenkins Shared Library <--------------

What is a shared library?
Why do we need it?

Maven for Java applications.

We would build a pipeline for each Microservice App.

Each Pipeline has its own Jenkinsfile, but this complicates the pipeline because each is using the same logic.
Enter Jenkins Shared Library!!!!


This is an extension to the Pipeline.
Has own repository.
Written in Groovy.
References shared login in Jenkinsfile.
This can be used in the company's pipeline.

Create the Shared Library (SL) 
Make SL available in Jenkins.
Use the SL in Jenkinsfile.

Create Shared Library Project/Repository? <------------------

- Create repository
- write the Groovy Code
- make the shared library available globally or for project
- use the shared library in Jenkinsfile to extend the Pipeline

Let's use IntelliJ for our Code writing.

Structure of Shared library:
Vars folder:
- functions that we call from JenkinsFile
- each function/execution step is its own Groovy file.

- build Jar file
- build Docker image
- push Docker Image.

src folder:
- helper code

resources folder:
- use external libraries
- non groovy files

THIS VIDEOS IS CODING BASED AND NEEDS TO BE REVISITED!!!!
